### How to submit a Pull Request

Still working on that part. What we can say now is:
1. Never create pull requests to version branches. They will be rejected without reviewing
2. Try avoiding making pull requests to master branch. Better for us wold be for developement branch
3. Call variables, functions, classes, etc. in English
